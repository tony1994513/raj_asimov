This package was used to understand working with movegroup interface of moveit!.

Most of the package was written for the PR2 robot however I have modified the following scripts and their launch files to work with cool400.

	doc/pr2_tutorials/kinematics/src/kinematic_model_tutorial.cpp
	doc/pr2_tutorials/planning/src/move_group_interface_tutorial.cpp
