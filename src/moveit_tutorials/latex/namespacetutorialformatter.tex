\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}    tutorialformatter
    ===========================

    This extension provides a directive to include a source code file
    in a document, but with certain comments from the file formatted
    as regular document text.  This allows code for a tutorial to look like:

        /// BEGIN_TUTORIAL
        /// This next line adds one.
        i = i + 1;
        /// Then we need to double it.
        i = i * 2;
        /// END_TUTORIAL

    And have it formatted as

    This next line adds one.::
        i = i + 1;

    Then we need to double it.::
        i = i * 2;

    The special-looking comment character sequence at the start of
    each text line can be anything not starting or ending with
    whitespace.  tutorialformatter starts by scanning the file for the
    string BEGIN_TUTORIAL.  When it finds it, it takes all the
    characters before BEGIN_TUTORIAL on that line, strips whitespace
    from the left, and uses that as the text marker.  So this would
    also be fine:

        #My Tutorial# BEGIN_TUTORIAL
        #My Tutorial# This next line adds one.
        i = i + 1
        #My Tutorial# Then we need to double it.
        i = i * 2
        #My Tutorial# END_TUTORIAL

    Sometimes the order that makes sense in the tutorial is not
    compatible with the computer language of the code, like when a
    callback function in C++ is defined outside of the main tutorial
    code.  To support this, you can use the tags BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL,
    END_SUB_TUTORIAL, and CALL_SUB_TUTORIAL.  They look like this:

        # BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL callbackFunction
        def callback():
            print "in callback"
        # END_SUB_TUTORIAL

        # BEGIN_TUTORIAL
        # Here we call a special callback:
        callback()
        # which is defined as:
        # CALL_SUB_TUTORIAL callbackFunction
        # and then we move on to the next topic.

    Both the BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL and CALL_SUB_TUTORIAL tags take an
    argument, which is the name of the "sub-tutorial".  That name does
    not need to correspond to anything in the code.  Sub-tutorials
    cannot be nested, and they only work within a single source file
    processed by tutorialformatter.  They have no outside meaning.
    The implementation simply slices out sub-tutorials from the input
    lines and copies them into the output lines where-ever the
    corresponding "call" tags are found.
